# Pin Board

It's a Pinterest clone made with Laravel PHP Framework.

User can login, register and create, delete and edit pin, with image upload, resizing and liking functionality.

This app is inspired by [Mackenzie Child](https://github.com/mackenziechild). Here is a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abcnfFS_DS8) where he built this blog in Rails 4.
